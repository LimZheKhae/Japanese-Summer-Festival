              <h2>Okonomiyaki</h2>

              <p>Okonomiyaki (Japanese: お好み焼き) is a savoury Japanese pancake meal 
			  made with wheat flour batter and other (combined or as toppings) 
			  ingredients baked on a teppan (flat griddle). Cabbage, beef, and 
			  shellfish are common ingredients, with okonomiyaki sauce (made with 
			  Worcestershire sauce), aonori (dried seaweed flakes), katsuobushi 
			  (bonito flakes), Japanese mayonnaise, and pickled ginger as toppings.</p>
 
              <p>Okonomiyaki is most commonly identified with two unique versions 
			  from Hiroshima or the Kansai region of Japan, but it is widely 
			  accessible across the country, with toppings and batters differing 
			  by region. The name comes from the Japanese words okonomi, which 
			  means "how you like" or "what you prefer," and yaki, which means 
			  "cooked." Konamono (Konamon in Kansai dialect), or flour-based 
			  Japanese food, is an example.</p>
			  
			  <p>Monjayaki is a liquid-based okonomiyaki popular in Kyoto. 
			  Outside of Japan, street sellers can be seen serving it in Manila, 
			  Taipei, Bangkok, and Jakarta.</p>
			  
			  <br>
			  <h2>History</h2>
			  
			  <p>Funoyaki [ja], a thin crêpe-like delicacy, may have been an 
			  early forerunner to okonomiyaki. Despite the dish's contents are 
			  unknown, they may have included fu. Records of the word funoyaki 
			  date back to the 16th century, as written about by tea expert Sen 
			  no Rikyū, and though the dish's ingredients are uncertain, it may 
			  have included fu (wheat gluten).  Funoyaki was a thin crêpe baked 
			  on a cooking pot with miso basted on one side by the late Edo era 
			  (1603–1867). This pastry is the forerunner of the current 
			  confections kintsuba (金つば), also known as gintsuba (銀つば) in Kyoto 
			  and Osaka, and taiko-yaki (also known as imagawayaki), both of 
			  which contain nerian (練り餡), a sweet bean paste.</p>
			  
			  <p>Monjiyaki (文字焼き), a related confection, was popular with children 
			  at dagashiya (駄菓子屋), stores selling cheap sweets during the Meiji 
			  era (1868–1912). This was prepared by using flour batter to make 
			  letters (monji) or pictures on a teppan (iron griddle) and then 
			  adding things of choice. The confectionery was also known as 
			  dondonyaki (どんどん焼き), which was derived from the onomatopoeia of 
			  stall vendors playing drums to attract customers.</p>
			  
			  <p>In the 1930s, the word "okonomiyaki" had its first appearance 
			  in an Osaka shop. Cooking these crêpes became a pastime after the 
			  1923 Great Kantō earthquake, when people lacked utilities, and 
			  following World War II (when rice was scarce), okonomiyaki arose 
			  as an economical and substantial dish for people of all ages, 
			  frequently with savoury toppings such as pork, seafood, and 
			  vegetables.  During the "okonomiyaki boom," commercially available 
			  domestic equipment and ingredients for the dish became available. 
			  Monjiyaki has also evolved into the comparable modern cuisine 
			  monjayaki (モンジャ焼き), which has a runnier batter due to the addition 
			  of additional water and a different cooked consistency.</p>
			  
			  <p>In the Taishō period (1912–1926), Kyoto's issen yōshoku [ja] 
			  (cheap Western-style cuisine) may have produced an early variant 
			  of current savoury okonomiyaki in the form of a pancake with 
			  Worcestershire sauce and chopped scallion.</p>
